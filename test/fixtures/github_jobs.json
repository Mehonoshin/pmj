We are moving from a traditional RoR architecture to a modern \"single page application\", exposing our application as a set of API's consumed by Ember to provide a rich interactive experience.</p>\n\n<p>To date we have migrated our customer facing application to an Ember app, with great success. We are currently working on rebuilding the backend of our platform with the present focus been on our \"Point of Sale\". We are now looking to add to our team to accelerate the creation and rollout of this change across the remainder of our platform. This covers the CRM, reporting/analytics and configurations aspects of our backend.</p>\n\n<p>To do this we are looking to hire new people to join our team. This person should be able to contribute across the entire development stack. However, we are looking for the new hire to have strong experience in building and rolling out SPAs. Ideally, with experience using Ember to do this.</p>\n\n<p>About Ticketsolve</p>\n\n<p>Ticketsolve is a web based online and box-office ticketing platform. We currently have over 220 clients based throughout UK and Ireland. These clients are a mixture of Theatres, Arts and Music Festivals and specialty offerings such as Ice Skating and Christmas attractions.

Our co-ordination and communication is largely through daily 'catch-up meetings' and use of appropriate tools such as Trello for backlog management, Slack for communication and Git(GitHub) for source control and feature deployment through PR's and Milestones.</p>\n\n<p>From a coding perspective we place a strong emphasis on clean, minimal, well refactored code backed up by strong suite of automated tests. We make use of peer review for all design and development work.</p>\n\n<p>In general we strive for an approach that empowers and trusts individuals to 'do the right thing' and as a team we try and keep each other true to this.</p>\n\n<p>Remote working</p>\n\n<p>Our development team works as a remote team with members in Berlin, Malm\u00f6, Barcelona, Singapore and Taiwan. Our wider organisation has people based in United Kingdom and Dublin. Dublin is our headquarters and only office space - with core Support team and Sales and Marketing team.</p>\n\n<p>Remote working has become part of our company DNA. We believe that it offers a lot of advantages to both Ticketsolve and employees. We expect that our new hires will likely be remote working. This means that you should be comfortable working as part of a remote team. If this is new to you, don't worry, it was for us at the beginning as well. We now have lots of experience helping people settle in - so keep an open mind and imagine a working day with no daily commute.</p>\n\n<p>Important to note that timezones are a consideration for us with remote working. Our experience is that European and Asian time zones are preferable, as it allows for collaboration at reasonable times. </p>\n\n<p>Recruitment process</p>\n\n<p>We are initially looking for resumes and portfolio examples of your work e.g. GitHub repositories, blog articles, etc. If you do not have anything suitable we can provide a problem piece to work together on.</p>\n\n<p>From there we filter down and do a series of remote interviews. These are often 'work' focused i.e. looking at code together, pair programming for example. Our preference is for candidates to talk to as much of the team as possible so that we, team and candidate, can make the best decision possible. If appropriate and makes sense we will also look at facilitating face to face meetings as well.</p>\n\n<p>After this stage we will be in a position to make a formal offer.</p>","how_to_apply":"<p>Send applications to <a href=\"mailto:shanly@ticketsolve.com\">shanly@ticketsolve.com</a></p>","company":"Ticketsolve","company_url":"https://www.ticketsolve.com/","company_logo":"http://github-jobs.s3.amazonaws.com/25205fda-286e-11e8-9426-14fa1cd3c5d7.png","url":"http://jobs.github.com/positions/86474fee-286e-11e8-92b1-5fdaa9539fbb"},{"id":"53aa3430-2859-11e8-99df-1c8ffbbe3aed","created_at":"Thu Mar 15 14:05:39 UTC 2018","title":"Backend Developer (Node.js)","location":"Berlin","type":"Full Time","description":"<p>We are looking for a skilled Backend/Node.js Developer to join our team and be responsible for the server-side of our web applications and automation of the default processes.</p>\n\n<p>You will work closely with Product to ensure that our server-side can deliver the features required both for the internal and customer-facing applications and together with our Frontend Developers evolve the core of our REST API.</p>\n\n<p>Your focus will be the evolution of our server-side logic and algorithms, the definition and maintenance of our APIs and databases, and ensure high performance and responsiveness to requests from the frontend.</p>\n\n<p>You have a serious passion for building server-side applications and prefer continuous deployment environments.

Simply: we help Brands become ecommerce empires.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2014, our mission has beento help as many brands as possible scale to the point where they are household names. And our goal is to be the very best at it. Since 2014, we\u2019ve established ourselves as the revolutionary innovators in a fast-paced industry. By helping quality brands grow, not only can we assist our clients to achieve their dreams, but we make the market a better place for consumers. Each member of our team shares in the joy and responsibility of making the ecommerce world a better place.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What We Are Looking For:</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are, essentially, looking for a Unicorn, and we understand this. We are searching for a capable, full-stack developer with leadership skills. Our project managers have superior coding capabilities because our projects are complex, and we aren\u2019t looking for a project lead who only understands the lingo.</p>\n\n<p>We need someone who can get into the codebase and get their hands dirty when necessary. The project lead will write the backlog and assign tasks to developers working on the project, but may also help correct complicated issues, and on particularly hairy deadlines, may also assist in coding.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019re looking for a self-starter and a team player who is able to adapt to a rapidly growing and evolving organization in an industry that moves fast. We\u2019re looking for a leader who can act as a multiplier and makes others around them better through automation, code review, documentation, mentoring when necessary, and who can lead a small team confidently. We\u2019re looking for a true software owner who genuinely cares about the impact our platform makes on the client and their Brand.

In the last 4 years, we\u2019ve grown exponentially, have been featured at major industry events, on podcasts, and have proudly served thousands of Brand owners. We\u2019ve had the honor of having a direct hand in taking entrepreneurs from mere idea to 7+ figure Brands.</p>\n\n<p>As a team, we consider working for our early-stage tech startup a lifetyle choice, rather than a job choice. Working for SixLeaf can be challenging at times. We operate in a competitive and fast moving industry, so we need to hit aggressive deadlines and there are many times when everyone on the team puts in a lot more hours than they are used to. You\u2019ll work hard but you\u2019ll face exciting challenges that allow you to put your mark on the world.</p>\n\n<p>As an important part of the SixLeaf team, you\u2019ll be responsible for creating innovative tools that help turn our client\u2019s Brands\u2019 into e-commerce empires.

You will immediately make a difference and impact on SixLeaf, its customers, and this industry.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Make More Money:</strong> To put it bluntly; we are generous. As a startup, we don\u2019t quite have each benchmark that determines bonus structures and pay increases set in stone yet, but we have consistently been extremely giving. We\u2019ve given a bonus each year for the \u201cChristmas\u201d season. We\u2019ve given raises after each 90-day probationary period. We also regularly increase pay based on exemplary performance. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Expand Your Skillset:</strong> You\u2019ll be exposed to developers around the world who each bring a unique set of skills to the table. You\u2019ll also be learning the intricacies of a relatively new industry to the SAAS space, which will require expansion on current knowledge. Overall, you will walk away from this job a more capable and productive individual having learned from the best in the industry.</p></li>\n</ul><p>At SixLeaf, and as a fully distributed team, we value respect, transparency, dedication, and innovation.

However, they can also tend to overcomplicate things. Often, if you ask a developer to turn on a light, he\u2019ll try to build a machine using complex algorithms and a system of wires to engage the light mechanism from their side of the room rather than just walk over to the switch and flip it.</p>\n\n<p>What we need is a project lead that brings balance between genius ideas and common sense solutions. Someone who is nimble, cross-disciplinary, and mindful of client needs. Someone who embraces being a key player in the leadership team. And someone who is results-driven, focused on problem-solving and who can act as a multiplier in any team.

Our CEO and CTO themselves are pushing for the creation of a dedicated data engineering and data science team to take its place at the centre of the company. </p>\n\n<p>A data warehouse project has begun, with 20 systems' backend databases replicated hourly or live into a multi-TB PostgreSQL instance. A \"clean\" (normalised) schema is created from it, a set of views that organises the data into a form that represents the real logic of the business cross-systems. The \"raw\" schema contains all the replicated databases, the \"logical\" schema contains the cross-system normalised information, and we're now building the part that gets from the first to the second.

For that matter, we also work in cross-functional teams frequently so you'll get to work with people in all different roles in the company. As a small sampling though, here are a few that you'll definitely rub digital shoulders with:</p>\n\n<p>Taylor, our CTO, was our digital nomad for a couple of years while he travelled...pretty much everywhere. He's now slowing down a bit and lives in Austin Texas, where he's learning to flex his handyman muscles while renovating their home. He's exceptionally good at escape room games and his super skill is explaining the rules of a board game in the most concise and understandable way you've ever heard. He also wins a lot of those board games.</p>\n\n<p>Sebastian, our mobile lead developer, works mostly on the iOS side of things here at YNAB. When he's not busy at YNAB he's either out walking the dogs, pretending to be a firefighter, feeding the cats or playing with his new server rack in the barn. He lives in rural Switzerland which might explain the barn - and by rural we mean it'd take you an hour to get to Zurich.</p>\n\n<p>Graham, our Android tech lead, is on a mission to convert everything to RxJava and Kotlin, and is constantly dabbling with various architecture patterns and solutions for cross-platform code-sharing. He lives in Scotland, where he hopes to one day be a decent enough guitarist to play a tune and actually have someone recognize it.</p>\n\n<p>He's an aviation geek who obsessively binge-watches entire seasons of Air Crash Investigations, just in case it might come in useful someday.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How You\u2019ll Work at YNAB</strong></p>\n\n<p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people\u2014the kind you\u2019ll be excited to work with. Here\u2019s how we operate:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Live Where You Want.</strong>\nWe\u2019re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn\u2019t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p>\n\n<p><strong>No Crazy Hours.</strong>\nWe rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we\u2019re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously).</strong>\nWe want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It\u2019s important to get out and do something. We\u2019ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The YNAB Retreat.</strong>\nWe get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we\u2019ve done Costa Rica, a gigantic cabin in the mountains, and a beach house in the Outer Banks. This year is a ranch in Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Up Your Game.</strong>\nWe\u2019re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!).. Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, books, dedicated time away from work to learn something new... it\u2019s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>If You\u2019re International...</strong>\nYou\u2019ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it\u2019s all the same to us. You\u2019re part of the team. As for time zones, we\u2019re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If You\u2019re Stateside\u2026</strong>\nYou\u2019ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we\u2019ve got you covered!)</p>\n\n<p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB\u2019s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You\u2019re not a PF junkie? Then trust us, it\u2019s great.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your \u201cBucket List\u201d spreadsheet with 50 items. (That\u2019s harder than it sounds!)</li>\n<li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li>\n<li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You\u2019ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li>\n<li>We\u2019re all adults. There\u2019s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you\u2019re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.</li>\n<li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we\u2019ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li>\n<li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people\u2019s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It\u2019s amazing. Don\u2019t underestimate this one!</li>\n</ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.  You will change lives. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Mobile Developer\u2026</strong></p>\n\n<p>You're a mobile developer with over 5 years of experience. At least two of those have been spent working with either iOS or Android, or both. (If you have experience with only one, you\u2019re excited to work with the other. We love both platforms for different reasons, and want you to as well.)  You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap.</p>\n\n<p>You'll help us implement new features and maintain existing apps on both iOS and Android. We have native implementations for each platform but use a shared library based on TypeScript for things that, well, need to be shared across platforms. For performance and maintainability reasons there is plenty of SQL code as well. You don't have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer will definitely help. Our baselines are Lollipop on Android and iOS 9 on iOS. You'll get to work with things like Kotlin and RxJava on Android. On iOS you'll work with Objective-C and Swift on a universal app and an Apple watch app.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You\u2019re the one we\u2019re looking for if you:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</li>\n<li>Write code that is easy for other programmers to understand and use.</li>\n<li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li>\n<li>Are self-motivated and thrive with directions like:\n\"This part of the program is too slow, and these are the places that might be good to start looking.\"<br>\n\"This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it?\"\n\u201cOur code needs to call into a Javascript library, but that Javascript library is crashing because it can\u2019t find the setTimeout method. Can you investigate?\u201d</li>\n<li>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</li>\n<li>Have experience with:\nKotlin / Java\nOr\nSwift / Objective-C</li>\n<li>Have shipped or helped ship at least one significant app for either iOS or Android.</li>\n<li>Are a senior developer who can point to strong experience where you\u2019ve exemplified the bullet points above.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Bonus Point:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You already use and love YNAB.</li>\n</ul><p>Salary will be between $90k and $125k, depending on experience.</p>\n\n<p>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what\u2019s another sentence or two\u2026</p>\n\n<p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apply <a href=\"https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0fe95\">here</a> <strong>by 11:59PM on March 25th, 2018</strong>.
